# 🛒 Full-Stack Ecommerce Platform

This is a full-stack ecommerce project built as a final semester capstone during my Bachelor's degree. It features both user-facing and admin-facing functionality, complete with a React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and MySQL database. All SQL queries were written manually from scratch — no ORM used.
